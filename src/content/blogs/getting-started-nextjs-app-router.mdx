# Getting Started with Next.js App Router

The **Next.js App Router** represents a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. Built on React Server Components, it offers unprecedented performance and developer experience.

## What is the App Router?

The App Router is a new routing system introduced in Next.js 13 and stabilized in Next.js 14+. It lives in the `app/` directory and brings several key improvements:

- **Server Components by default** - Better performance and SEO
- **Nested layouts** - Share UI across routes
- **Loading states** - Built-in support for loading UI
- **Error handling** - Automatic error boundaries

## Key Concepts

### 1. File-based Routing

```tsx
app/
  page.tsx          // → /
  blog/
    page.tsx        // → /blog
    [slug]/
      page.tsx      // → /blog/:slug
```

### 2. Server vs Client Components

By default, all components are **Server Components**. Use the `"use client"` directive when you need:

- State management (useState, useReducer)
- Effect hooks (useEffect)
- Browser APIs
- Event handlers

```tsx
"use client";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

### 3. Data Fetching

Server Components can `async/await` directly:

```tsx
async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

## Why Migrate?

The benefits are compelling:

1. **Better Performance** - Automatic code splitting and optimized bundles
2. **Improved SEO** - Server-rendered by default
3. **Simplified Data Fetching** - No more getServerSideProps
4. **Better UX** - Streaming and Suspense built-in

## Getting Started

Create a new Next.js app with the App Router:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

That's it! You're ready to build modern web applications with Next.js.

## Conclusion

The App Router is the future of Next.js development. While there's a learning curve, the benefits in performance, developer experience, and user experience make it well worth the investment.

Happy coding! 🚀
